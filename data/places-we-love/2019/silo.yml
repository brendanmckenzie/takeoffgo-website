  The Silo Hotel has been built in the grain elevator portion of
  the historic grain silo complex occupying six floors above
  Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (MOCAA) which houses
  Africa’s largest collection of contemporary African art.

  Only guests of the 28-room boutique hotel have the pleasure of
  floating in the rooftop pool while taking in views of Table
  Mountain, Lion’s Head, the Atlantic Ocean, and the city
  skyline.

  The Silo Hotel is a celebration of art, style, architecture
  and design. A tribute to timeless glamour and contemporary
  luxury offering the highest levels of personalised service.
